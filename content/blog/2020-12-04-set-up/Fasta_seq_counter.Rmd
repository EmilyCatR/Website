FASTA files are files that contain DNA sequences. They can be read in and evaluated through python a few different ways. New sequences are denoted by a ">" in the first line.

<br>

In this first method, I use a loop to count the number of sequences.
```{python}

def fasta():
    filename=input("please enter FASTA file name (e.g name.fasta): ")
    file_handle = open(filename, "r") # open in 'r' mode  to read the file
    #contents = file_handle.read() # reads the entire file
    
    seq_num= 0
    for line in file_handle:
        for char in line:
            if char == ">":
                seq_num += 1
    print("The file contains" , seq_num , "sequence(s).")          
    
    file_handle.close()
```

<br>
In this second way, I create a function and use regex (easy to understand and faster to write) to count the number of sequences in the file.

```{python}

def seq_num():
    filename=input("please enter FASTA file name (e.g name.fasta): ")
    file_handle = open(filename, "r") # open in 'r' mode  to read the file
    contents = file_handle.read()

    seq=re.findall(r'>', contents)
    seq_num=len(seq)
    print("The file contains" , seq_num , "sequence(s).") 
    
    file_handle.close()
    
seq_num()

```
