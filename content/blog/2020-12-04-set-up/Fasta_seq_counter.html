<p>FASTA files are files that contain DNA sequences. They can be read in and evaluated through python a few different ways. New sequences are denoted by a &quot;&gt;&quot; in the first line.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In this first method, I use a loop to count the number of sequences.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>
def fasta():
    filename=input(&quot;please enter FASTA file name (e.g name.fasta): &quot;)
    file_handle = open(filename, &quot;r&quot;) # open in &#39;r&#39; mode  to read the file
    #contents = file_handle.read() # reads the entire file
    
    seq_num= 0
    for line in file_handle:
        for char in line:
            if char == &quot;&gt;&quot;:
                seq_num += 1
    print(&quot;The file contains&quot; , seq_num , &quot;sequence(s).&quot;)          
    
    file_handle.close()</code></pre>
<p><br> In this second way, I create a function and use regex (easy to understand and faster to write) to count the number of sequences in the file.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>
def seq_num():
    filename=input(&quot;please enter FASTA file name (e.g name.fasta): &quot;)
    file_handle = open(filename, &quot;r&quot;) # open in &#39;r&#39; mode  to read the file
    contents = file_handle.read()

    seq=re.findall(r&#39;&gt;&#39;, contents)
    seq_num=len(seq)
    print(&quot;The file contains&quot; , seq_num , &quot;sequence(s).&quot;) 
    
    file_handle.close()</code></pre>
