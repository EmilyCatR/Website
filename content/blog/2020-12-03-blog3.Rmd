Nucleotide sequences can be read in three different reading frame (i.e starting on first nucelotide, second or thrida nucleotide and grouping bases in groups of three.) One can find all the k-mers, or groups of three starting the reading frame on any nucleotide, then counting up the intsnaces in which that k-mer sequence occurs. I created a function that takes in a sequence, finds all the k-mers, and stores them in a dictionary.


```{python}
import re 
from collections import Counter

my_seq1 = "ATCATCATG"
my_seq2 = "CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT"

def kmers(seq):
  n=len(my_seq1)
  unique_mer_list=[]
  mer_list=[]
  
  #finding mers
  mer1=re.findall(r"...", seq)
  mer2=re.findall(r"...", seq[1:n])
  mer3=re.findall(r"...", seq[2:n])
  
  #add all mers to mer_list
  for m in mer1:
    mer_list.append(m)
  for m in mer2:
    mer_list.append(m)
  for m in mer3:
    mer_list.append(m)
  
  #count instances:
  dict=Counter(mer_list)
  print(dict)
  
kmers(my_seq1)
kmers(my_seq2)
```
